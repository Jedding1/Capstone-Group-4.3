NOTE: run setup.sh first, this will download all the software needed for mobsfscan for ios and android.

For ANDROID:
run mobsfscan.sh for apk file analysis

For iOS:
for iOS you need to run two scripts the first being run_mobsf.sh that will launch mobsf, then in a new terminal tab run ios_mobs.sh then it will ask for an ipa
file that is located in the scripts directory

DISCLAIMER: some tools that are installed on this script rely on a specific verison of tools, if at some point in the future there are other versions available,
modifiy the script to account for this.
